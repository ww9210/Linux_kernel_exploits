# Linux_kernel_exploits
Some Linux kernel exploits for various real world kernel vulnerabilities here.
More exploits are yet to come.


This repo contains the exploits developed during a research project, as well as the code of FUZE to facilitate exploit generation.

## What is FUZE
FUZE is a framework to facilitate linux kernel exploitation, here is the baisc idea of how it works:

1. **Critical information extraction** we need to understand both spatial and temporal metadata of this vulnerability 
2. **under context kernel fuzzing** to find sensitive operation over the vulnerable object, e.g. dereferencing a dangling pointer
3. **partial symbolic execution** After finding the dereference site of the vulnerable object, we start execution right before the dereference site, set the value in vulnerable object which can be controlled by us as symbolic bytes.

## Dependency
angr, qemu-system-x86_64, ROPGadget, pwntools, GDB, gef, capstone, KASAN, ftrace

## Install
To install FUZE, run the following command

```
git clone https://github.com/ww9210/Linux_kernel_exploits
cd Linux_kernel_exploits
python setup.py install --user
```

## Documentation
TODO here, currently you can browser the code under fuze/test
